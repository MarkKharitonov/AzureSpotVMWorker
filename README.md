# AzureSpotVMWorker
# This is an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template to deploy an Azure Spot VM instance specifically for the Folding@home client.
# You will need to update the parameters JSON file to reflect your own Azure subscription and resources.
# Spot instnaces are currently available in Preview in the US East and South Central US Azure regions. South Central has more availability and is cheaper for Spot VMs currently.
# As of April 2020, each VM deployment costs about $0.40/day once all disk, computer, and network resources are factored. This is subject to change with Spot VM demand.

# Please reach out to me if I can help with your setup: info@covid19folding.org or @josh_heffner on Twitter.
